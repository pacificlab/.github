# Welcome to the PACIFIC Lab!

At our lab, we research aspects of Privacy, Applied Cryptography, Intelligence, and Forensics In Chips (PACIFIC). This includes but is not limited to research on implementation security and efficiency of cryptographic schemes, novel side-channel analysis and fault injection techniques, advancing hardware security primitives such as True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), and applied research of embedded security including micro-architectures and low level firmware.

## Archived Artifacts for Research Papers

This category contains unmaintained projects to complement our research papers. This practice has become more popular, to ensure that results can be reproduced or improved more easily. Please be aware, that these projects are not guaranteed to remain functional due to external dependencies.
